<h1 align="center">Lua Learning Project: BYTEPATH</h1>

## Description

This is a learning project with the goal of cloning the game **BYTEPATH** using elementary game development workflows and higher-level software engineering approaches. 

**BYTEPATH** is an independent game designed, created, and published by **adn** (**[@a327ex](https://github.com/a327ex)**). It is described as a "replayable arcade shooter with a focus on build theorycrafting" and is accompanied by a fleshed-out tutorialized project guide intended for experienced programmers and software developers with a desire for leveling their skills in game development and Lua scripting. 

To track this project's completion via discretized objectives, please navigate to **[OBJECTIVES.md](OBJECTIVES.md)** to access an abstracted breakdown of each tutorialized chapter and the goals therein. 

## Languages and Dependencies

## Acknowledgements
