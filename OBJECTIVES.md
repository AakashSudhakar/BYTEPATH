# Objectives for Project Completion

### Step 1: **Game Loop**

The primary objective of this step is to set up the LÃ–VE dependency and ensure Lua is appropriately managed and configured on my platform. 

Afterwards, the primary "game loop" for the entire game will be set up as a boilerplate to ensure that primary logic can be scaffolded and instantiated early on and that more specialized elements can be added as time goes on. 

#### **Game Loop Exercises:**

1. What is the role that Vsync plays in the game loop? (It is enabled by default and it can be disabled by calling `love.window.setMode` with the `vsync` attribute set to false.)

2. Implement the `Fixed Delta Time` loop from the **[Fix Your Timestep article](https://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/)** by changing `love.run`.

3. Implement the `Variable Delta Time` loop from the **[Fix Your Timestep article](https://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/)** by changing `love.run`.

4. Implement the `Semi-Fixed Timestep` loop from the **[Fix Your Timestep article](https://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/)** by changing `love.run`.

5. Implement the `Free the Physics` loop from the **[Fix Your Timestep article](https://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/)** by changing `love.run`.
