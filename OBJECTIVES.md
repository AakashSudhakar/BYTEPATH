### Step 1: **Game Loop**

The primary objective of this step is to set up the LÃ–VE dependency and ensure Lua is appropriately managed and configured on my platform. 

Afterwards, the primary "game loop" for the entire game will be set up as a boilerplate to ensure that primary logic can be scaffolded and instantiated early on and that more specialized elements can be added as time goes on.
